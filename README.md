# iptables & ip6tables

Basic `iptables` and `ip6tables` setup for normal operation. Feel free to fork and widen its potential.

***

These are my basic `rules.v4` (IPv4) and `rules.v6` (IPv6) for `iptables-persistent` package. Just put these files in `/etc/iptables/`. Most suitable for beginners, but not limited, as these rules can easily be re-used.
