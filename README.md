# `iptables` & `ip6tables`

Basic `iptables` and `ip6tables` setup for normal desktop Linux operation.

***

These are my basic `rules.v4` (IPv4) and `rules.v6` (IPv6) for `iptables-persistent` package. Just put these files in `/etc/iptables/`.

***

As many users are already moving towards `nftables`, I will try and see later on, what I can do for you with it.
